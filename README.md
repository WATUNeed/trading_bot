# trading_bot
Test task.
A trading bot, based on the macd metric.
ETHBTC was chosen to exclude influence of BTCUSDT. Thus, trading is based only on ETH movement. 
Futures trades are also opened in ETHBTC, but you can change the pair to ETHUSDT (In this case buy and sell signals will not always be accurate).

The signal to buy is when the macd indicator changes from negative to positive.
A signal to sell is when the macd indicator changes from positive to negative.

Bot is based on one metric as it is an example program, and can not guarantee 100% result.
